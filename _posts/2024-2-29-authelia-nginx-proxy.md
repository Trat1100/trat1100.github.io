## Create your Authelia Entry in NGinX Proxy Manager

Now, you'll need to create an entry for the authelia front end in NGinX Proxy Manager. Somthing like `auth.your-domain.org`, of course replacing `your-domain.org` with your actual domain. Go ahead nad make sure it opens properly without SSL, then setup the LetsEncrypt SSL on your new auth domain.

Now, test it again, and make sure it comes up with SSL. Once that's working we'll edit it one more time, and need to add some specific text / configuration to the Advanced tab of our auth entry. For the most part this will be copy paste, with one modification.

```conf
location / {
        set $upstream_authelia http://<authelia-server-ip-and:port>; # e.g. http://192.168.1.13:9091 
        proxy_pass $upstream_authelia;
        client_body_buffer_size 128k;
 
        #Timeout if the real server is dead
        proxy_next_upstream error timeout invalid_header http_500 http_502 http_503;
 
        # Advanced Proxy Config
        send_timeout 5m;
        proxy_read_timeout 360;
        proxy_send_timeout 360;
        proxy_connect_timeout 360;
 
        # Basic Proxy Config
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $http_host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Uri $request_uri;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Ssl on;
        proxy_redirect  http://  $scheme://;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Connection "";
        proxy_cache_bypass $cookie_session;
        proxy_no_cache $cookie_session;
        proxy_buffers 64 256k;
 
        # If behind reverse proxy, forwards the correct IP
        set_real_ip_from 10.0.0.0/8;
        set_real_ip_from 172.0.0.0/8;
        set_real_ip_from 192.168.0.0/16;
        set_real_ip_from fc00::/7;
        real_ip_header X-Forwarded-For;
        real_ip_recursive on;
    }
```

>In the above text, make sure to change the part where it says <authelia-server-ip-and:port> to be your authelia server's IP and Port number, then Save.
{: .prompt-info }

## Installing Authelia:

For Authelia, you'll need 3 files:

* Docker-Compose for Authelia
* configuration.yml
* users_database.yml

#### Docker-Compose for Authelia
In your server, create a new folder called "authelia", and move into that folder:
```shell
mkdir authelia
cd authelia
```
Now, create two more folders called "config" and "redis"
```shell
mkdir config
mkdir redis
```
Finally, create a new file called "docker-compose.yml":
```shell
nano docker-compose.yml
```
And paste the following text into it:
```yaml
version: '3.3'
services:
  authelia:
    image: authelia/authelia
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
    ports:
      - 9091:9091
    restart: unless-stopped
    healthcheck:
      disable: true
    environment:
      - TZ=America/Chicago
    depends_on:
      - redis

  redis:
    image: redis:alpine
    volumes:
      - ./redis:/data
    expose:
      - 6379
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - TZ=America/Chicago
```

Once pasted, make sure to change the left side of the port mapping if necessary from 9091 to any free port you have on your server.  If 9091 is free, then leave it as is.  

>If you change the port here, you must go back and change it in your NGinX Proxy Manager advanced tab, as well as the main tab for your "auth.your-dormain.org" entry.
{: .prompt-warning }
Next, change the timezone ( TZ ) environment variable to your timezone.  


Now save the file with CTRL + O, then press Enter to confirm, and use CTRL + X to exit.
 
>We can't run the compose file just yet, as we have a couple of other files to create first.
{: .prompt-danger }

#### The Configuration File
Now we need to create our Authelia main configuration file. Change into the "config" directory and create a new file called "configuration.yml":
```shell
cd config
nano configuration.yml
```
 
In that file, paste the following:

```yml

```

In the above file, make sure to change any field with "<" and ">" symbols around the text.  Make sure you have updated all values to meet your needs.  For more information on what each of these options are check the Authelia documentation.

Once you have pasted, and updated the file above, save it with CTRL + O, then Enter to confirm, and exit with CTRL + X.

#### The Users Database file
Finally, we need to create a file for our users.  This wile will be called "users_database.yml".

While still in the "config" directory, create the new file:
```shell
nano users_database.yml
```
then paste the following into the file, and modify according to your needs.

```yml
users:
  john:
    displayname: "John Doe"
    password: "$argon2id$v=19$m=65536,t=3,p=2$BpLnfgDsc2WD8F2q$o/vzA4myCqZZ36bUGsDY//8mKUYNZZaR0t4MFFSs+iM"
    email: john.doe@authelia.com
    groups:
      - admins
      - dev
  harry:
    displayname: "Harry Potter"
    password: "$argon2id$v=19$m=65536,t=3,p=2$BpLnfgDsc2WD8F2q$o/vzA4myCqZZ36bUGsDY//8mKUYNZZaR0t4MFFSs+iM"
    email: harry.potter@authelia.com
    groups: []
```
In the example file above, we have two users.  John and Harry.  If you only need 1 user, you would simply remove the section for Harry, and modify the section for John.

The password for the user you create must be entered as a hashed password, and not in plain text. In order to get the hashed password, you'll use the following command:
```shell
docker run authelia/authelia:latest authelia hash-password 'yourpassword'
```
Replace `'yourpassword'` in the above command with the actual plain text password you want for your user.

Press enter, and allow the command to run.  If you've not already pulled down the authelia/authelia image, it will pull down at this point from dockerhub, so be patient the first time you run this command.

Once complete, copy the hashed password from the command line by highlighting it, and using a `right-click >> copy`, or `CTRL + Shift + C` to copy it, and then re-open your users_database.yml file and paste the full hash between the double quotation marks.

Save the file again, and you're set.

## Running Authelia:
We can finally test the authelia setup.  We don't have any web applications protected by it just yet, but we can make sure that it's working, and that we can authenticate.

Move back out of the "config" directory one level with:
```shell
cd ..
```
and then run 
```shell
docker-compose up -d
```
This will pull down Redis, and startup Authelia and Redis.  Watch the output for errors, but if everything is setup properly, you sould see a message that says Authelia is running at 0.0.0.0:`9091`.

Open your browser (or a new tab) and go to `https://auth.<your-domain.org>` <â€“ of course using your actual domain.
 
You should be prompted with the login screen.  You can now enter your username and password, and make sure you're able to login.

## Setup our NGinX Proxy Manager sites for Authelia
 
For each site you put in the Authelia configuration file, you need to add a proxy host entry in NGinX Proxy Manager. Make sure you've setup each site in NPM, then on the Advanced tab for each one you'll need to add the following JSON. This long text only needs a few changes, and once you do it for the first site, copy and paste it from one to the next, and you'll only need to make 1 or 2 changes each time.

```
location /authelia {
    internal;
    set $upstream_authelia http://<your-authelia-server-ip-and:port>/api/verify; #ADD YOUR IP AND PORT OF AUTHELIA
    proxy_pass_request_body off;
    proxy_pass $upstream_authelia;    
    proxy_set_header Content-Length "";

        proxy_set_header Connection "";

        proxy_no_cache $cookie_session;
        proxy_buffers 64 256k;
 
        # add your ip range here, and remove this comment!
        set_real_ip_from 192.168.7.0/16;
        set_real_ip_from 172.0.0.0/8;
        real_ip_header X-Forwarded-For;
        real_ip_recursive on;
    }
```

In the above file, you need to change the 5 portions with the "<" and ">" around them.  

* On part 1, enter the IP and Port of your authelia server (auth.your-domain.org). <br> `<your-authelia-server-ip-and:port>` --> put your actual authelia ip and port number here.  You only need to edit this the first time, then copy and paste the same config to each site you are setting up as this value will always be the same.

* In part 2, you need to change the following: <br>`<appname>` --> whatever simple name defines the app (e.g. homer, ntop, jitsi, npmui, etc).  This will be different for each entry you make in NGinX Proxy Manager for different sites.<br> `application-ip-and:port` --> The IP address and port number for the application you are placing behind Authelia.  This will be different for each entry in NGinX Proxy Manager for different sites. <br>`auth.<example.com>` should be changed to the domain / subdomain for your authelia server.  Change this the first time you make this file, then just use it over and over as this value will remain the same.

* Finally, under the 'real ip' section, you may need to add your local network IP range. For instance if your network is `10.21.0.0` based, then you'll want to add a line like:<br> `set_real_ip_from 10.21.0.0/16`

That's it.  Save your configuration, and give it a try.

{: .prompt-tip }
 
Test your site, if all is setup correctly, you'll be taken to the Authelia sign in page.  Depending on whether you set the site for one_factor or two_factor, you may also be asked to setup your TOTP app, and use your one time pin as well.
